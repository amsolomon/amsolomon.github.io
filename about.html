                <h1> A Short Bio</h1>
                <p></p>
                <p> I have a strong passion for music which really influences my life. I grew up playing the cello, on the worlds most famous beach, Daytona Beach, Florida. I feel very lucky to live in central Florida, as it seems to be a hot-bed of musical activity. Florida is a great market, and every band comes through. So I am able to go to a mass amount of really great shows and festivals. Over the past few years I have furthered my love of music by taking a step into the music industry as staff writer for ThePier.org. In this position I spend an excessive amount of time extensively researching the siteâ€™s relevant genres, talking directly with artists and management, using the information to compose PR style news update articles on artist news, albums, singles, tours, as well as live concert coverage. I believe the skills associated with this position, such as musical research abilities, attention to detail, listening, and client communications, as well as others proficiencies gained in past retail marketing experience will contribute to my ability to maintain a successful career in music. </p>
